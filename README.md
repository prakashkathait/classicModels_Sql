# SQL- Classic Model 

In this project , I analyzed customer purchases and orders across different countries to evaluate the revenue generated for the company. The analysis focused on various product types and assessed the associated profit or loss. Key insights include identifying the most sold product, understanding customer payment statuses, and analyzing customer order rates.

### Steps followed 

- Importing the data by running the script on the sql workbench.
- There are 8 tables which will be added post running the script in the newly created schema
        
### Questions raised from the analysis 

-Q1. Calculate the average order amount of each country?
    
      select country, AVG(priceEach*quantityOrdered) as order_amount  from customers c 
      INNER JOIN orders o ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
      INNER JOIN orderdetails od ON od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
      GROUP BY 1
      ORDER BY order_amount DESC;

      SELECT od1.productCode as product1,
      p1.productName as productname1,
      od2.productCode AS product2,
      p2.productname AS productname2,
      COUNT(*) AS co_purchase_count
      FROM orderdetails od1 JOIN orderdetails od2 ON od1.orderNumber = od2.orderNumber and od1.productCode <> od2.productCode
      JOIN products p1 ON p1.productCode = od1.productCode
      JOIN products p2 ON p2.productCode = od2.productCode
      GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
